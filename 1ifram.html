       <h3 id="h1 ">What Is a Visa?</h3>
           <p >A visa is an official document that allows the bearer to legally enter a foreign country. The visa is usually stamped or glued into the bearer's passport. There are several different types of visas, each of which afford the bearer different rights in the host country.
           Check out How Do I Apply for a Visa? for more information.</p>

   <div class="column">
     <h3 id="h2"> What Is a Travel/Tourist Visa? </h3>
     <p>Travel visas allow the bearer to enter a foreign country for touristic and leisure purposes only and stay for a predetermined amount of time. These visas do not entitle the holder to work or engage in any business activities in the host country.</p>
    </div>

	<div class="column">
       <h3 id="h3">Which Countries Can I Travel to Visa-Free?</h3>
           <p >Check out Passport Index to find out where you can travel visa-free with your current passport. Currently UAE has the most visa-free access with 175 countries, while Afghanistan has the least access with visa-free travel to only 30 countries.</p>
    </div>

   
   <div class="column">
     <h3 id="h4"> What Can I Learn From the Visa Restrictions Index? </h3>
     <p>Passport Index focuses not on the visa restrictions but rather on the possibilities and freedom that passports offer. The Passport Compare tool allows users to see which countries they can visit visa-free and compare their passport against others.
     The United States has several visa restrictions that affect whether a potential visitor is granted a tourist visa. Visa applications may be denied on the grounds of health, a criminal record or other security reasons. For example, anyone with a significant communicable disease or a physical or mental health disorder that poses a safety threat will not be allowed entry into the US.

	<div class="column">
       <h3 id="h5">What Does a Visa Look Like?</h3>
           <p >Traditional visas can either be stamped or glued into your passport. If your visa is glued into your passport, it is usually a small document that includes your name, passport number, place of birth, reason for travel and expiration date. Stamped visas typically have less information on them. They usually only have the destination and date from which the visa is valid and official instructions stating how many days the visa is valid for.</p>

   <div class="column">
     <h3 id="h6" >What Are the Supporting Documents Required for Visitor Visas?</h3>
     <p>When filing your visa application with the embassy of the country you intend to visit, you will be asked to include supporting documents with the main visa application. The following is a list of commonly requested supporting documents:<br>

      Letter of invitation.<br>
      A photocopy of the information page of your passport.<br>
     One or two photographs of a specific size determined by the visa office.<br>
     Proof of financial support during the trip.<br>
     Travel insurance.<br>
     Airplane tickets.<br>
     Proof of purpose of travel.<br>
    Visa application fees.<br>

<div class="column">
       <h3 id="h8">What to Expect During a Visa Interview?</h3>
           <p >Once you have filed your visa application, you may be requested to submit to a visa interview by the country you intend to visit. Most visa applications are approved or denied without the need for an interview, but the visa officer may request one. The following are common questions you may be asked during a visa interview:<br>

Why do you want to travel to X country?<br>
Why do you want to visit at this specific time?<br>
Do you have a criminal record?<br>
Are you travelling with someone else?<br>
Who will you be visiting?<br>
How long will you stay?<br>
Where will you stay?<br>
Have you booked airline tickets?<br>
Do you have health insurance for this trip?<br>
If you are currently employed, do you have proper leave from your workplace for the duration of the trip?<br>
Will you return to your home country after your visit?.</p>

    <div class="column">
       <h3 id="h7">What Are Visa Processing Times?</h3>
           <p >Every country processes visa applications at a different rate. Make sure to check the government website of the country you intend to visit to find out how fast they process visa applications. For example, visa applications from Russia to visit Canada take approximately 8 days to process, while Canadians looking to travel to India are advised to submit visa applications at least 15 days in advance.</p>
